            Full-fibre coverage is growing, but availability varies by postcode. Enter your address into a postcode checker to see if you can access FTTP services.

            How do I switch if I'm still in a contract?

          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">

          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
