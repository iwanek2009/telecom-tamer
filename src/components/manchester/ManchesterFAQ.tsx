            Can I get premium channels like Sky Sports or BT Sport with an internet bundle?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            Yes, many providers offer sports add-ons or specialized packages that include premium sports channels alongside broadband.

            Is it cheaper to combine TV and internet than to buy them separately?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            Often, yes. Bundling can lower overall monthly costs, especially if you need both services anyway. However, it's wise to compare standalone plans versus bundles to be sure.

          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            Depending on the provider and the type of connection, installation can range from a self-install kit (a few minutes) to an engineer visit (several hours).

            Do I have to get a landline with my TV & internet package?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            Many bundles do include a landline by default, but broadband-only or internet-plus-TV packages without a phone line are increasingly common.

          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            First, troubleshoot by repositioning your router or checking for device conflicts. If speeds remain poor, contact your provider for assistance. Some offer speed guarantees or refunds for persistent issues.

          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 px-6 pb-4">
            You can, but you'll likely face early termination fees. Weigh those costs against the potential savings from switching to a cheaper or more suitable package.
